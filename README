duhttp
======
duhttp is a small, simple and hackable multithreaded HTTP server writen in one file of POSIX C99. (use at your own risk).
It is currently far from complete (about 20%). It supports a very primitive form of "CGI", and has directory listing (both features will be refined in the future).

It will treat the current working dir as the server root on startup.

Installation
------------
Run `make`. The binary should appear in `bin`.

Supported HTTP requests
------------------------
duhttp supports the following requests:
	- GET
	- HEAD
	- POST (WIP)

Bug reports
